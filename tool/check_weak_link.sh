# Fail unless every Mach-O binary in an app bundle that links Apple's
# FoundationModels framework links it weakly (LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB).
#
# An app that strong-links FoundationModels will not launch on iOS 18 or
# macOS 15 and earlier, where the framework does not exist. The
# on_device_ai_apple plugin declares the framework weak and guards every use
# with @available(iOS 26.0, macOS 26.0, *); this script checks that the built
# binaries agree. It also fails when nothing links the framework at all, which
# would mean the plugin never made it into the build.
#
# Usage: tool/check_weak_link.sh <path/to/App.app>
# The path may contain spaces or `!` (the macOS bundle is "MyDevice!!!!!.app"),
# so always quote it. See doc/en-us/ci-cd.md and doc/en-us/on-device-ai.md.
